# The code `while True: click(random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0,100)) time.sleep(1)` is an
# infinite loop that continuously clicks at random positions on the screen with a delay of 1 second
# between each click. The `click` function is called with random x and y coordinates generated using
# `random.randint(0, 100)`. This code is often used for automation or testing purposes, where you want
# to simulate mouse clicks at random positions on the screen.
